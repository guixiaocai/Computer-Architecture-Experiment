# Computer-Architecture-Experiment
It's computer architecture experiment in UCAS.
The total experiment includes 6 labs:                             
1.multi-cycle CPU                    
2.MIPS CPU with 5 level static pipeline                   
3.assembly coding task --- an electronic clock                      
4.support exceptions                          
5.support bus interface                          
6.fill in the initial programme of CPU                         
The experiment needs specific environment and vivado tools.                          
Some labs are not finished well, and the most important use of this repo is a record.
